When designing products, personas are usually the first things\nthat are developed. They help guide decision-making, such that products can be\ntailored to these manufactured identities. Designers build the \"customer\njourney\" around these personas which (for better or worse) constrain the\nexperience of a product. Emacs on the other hand is designed contrary to\npersonas. Goetz describes that instead of pre-designed constraints, users are\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`intentionally`}</strong>{` given a rich context of tools and information (Elisp\npackages/apps/configuration). Providing this complexity is intended to\neliminate constraints, allowing users to `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`be`}</strong>{` their own personas, and create\ntheir own product. Instead of the user living an experience built around some\nnotion of a person, the user is enabled to let their `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`unique`}</strong>{` persona dictate\ntheir experience.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Goetz then continues to describe the most important point (in my opinion) that\nthe ability to build our own experiences and extend our freedom is an\nimportant skill in life, as it helps us contextualize our own decision-making\nprocesses and is the first step in learning how to learn.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is a mind bomb and reminded me of the ideas from the post `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://batsov.com/articles/2021/11/24/emacs-is-a-lifestyle/%5D%5B\"\n      }}>{`\"Emacs is a\nlifestyle\"`}</a>{` by Bozhidar Batsov. Just like how Goetz describes the Emacs\nexperience as an exercise in contextualizing your own decision-making process,\nBastov emphasizes the similar idea that Emacs offers one of the most valuable\nfeatures, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`the choice to configure`}</strong>{`, which most other software doesn't.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This nugget of wisdom is a great snippet that represents the Emacs user\nexperience. Instead of thinking of software as something you have to \"gel\"\nwith, Emacs \"gels\" with you.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"emacs-demonstrates-that-the-unix-philosophy-isnt-the-only-answer\"\n    }}>{`Emacs demonstrates that the UNIX philosophy isn't the only answer`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In the short talk `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/unix/\"\n      }}>{`Why Emacs demonstrates the UNIX philosophy isn't the only\nanswer`}</a>{`, Daniel Rose talks about how Emacs fits within the UNIX philosophy. He\nalso addresses the usefulness of software philosophies in general.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The most useful piece of advice to me was when Rose mentions: \"philosophies\ndon't mean everything.\" In the context of Emacs, Rose is implying that just\nbecause Emacs `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`can`}</strong>{` accomplish a task doesn't mean it `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`should`}</strong>{`. Rose relates\nto this point with a personal anecdote of using Android Studio over Emacs for\ndevelopment. Just as there are many tools better suited for Android\ndevelopment than Emacs, there are other situations where Emacs is the inferior\ntool.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My thoughts on this talk are extremely positive. I think `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`every`}</strong>{` EmacsConf\nneeds to have a talk that mentions the point \"you should choose the best tool\nfor the job.\" The half serious, half joke of Emacs being more of an OS than a\ntext editor makes the community look big-headed. With all the talks mentioning\nthe things that Emacs `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`can`}</strong>{` do, grounding the conference by mentioning what it\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`can't`}</strong>{` do is always a nice breath of fresh air.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"takeaways\"\n    }}>{`Takeaways`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Both of these talks from this years EmacsConf are worth mentioning because\nthey highlight the simultaneous liberties and restrictions Emacs provides.\nI'm grateful EmacsConf releases all this free content because it gives me\naccess to all the liberties of Emacs, and lets me acknowledge and internalize\nall its restrictions.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I've been using Emacs for ~5 years and although all the tweaking and tuning\ncan be tedious, it's allowed me to reflect and rebuild `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`my`}</strong>{` best user\nexperience. The practice of constantly reevaluating what makes me effective\nnot only keeps my brain fluid, but keeps me thinking how to continually evolve\nmyself.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Emacs definitely isn't for everyone and I don't recommend it often. However if\nyou really want to customize your workflow or can't find another tool that\nsuits you, it just might be worth a try.`}</p>\n    <p><inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`~(^-^)~`}</inlineCode></p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXLayout","DefaultLayout","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","parentName","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
