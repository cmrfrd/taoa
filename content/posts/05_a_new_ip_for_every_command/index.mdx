## The normal way to change IPs

It's very handy as a programmer to change your public facing IP. Whether you
want to pretend your computer is in a different country or just want to get
around an IP ban, being able to masquerade your IP has many utilities.

The "normal" way I've always done this is to run `openvpn` as a background
process, do what I want to do, then kill the process.

When I was testing some IP banning tooling I quickly came across the problem
that switching locations/IPs multiple times gets annoying. So I wanted to
build a utility to make it easier.

The ideal experience I wanted was to be able to run command isolated from the
rest of my local network, yet be connected to a VPN whose location I can
change with a single argument.


## Coding it up

Since I wanted isolation for this tool, I chose `podman` as it's my goto
container engine for my one off isolation needs. The simplest place I started
was with a quick script to build an `ovpn` alpine image like so:

```bash
NAME=ovpn
cat << EOF > /tmp/Dockerfile.${NAME}
FROM alpine:3.12
RUN apk add --no-cache openvpn bash
EOF
EMPTY=$(mktemp -d)
podman build -q -t ${NAME} -f /tmp/Dockerfile.${NAME} $EMPTY 2>&1 > /dev/null
```

The immediate problem that I had with this approach was that the container
image doesn't include any of my local tools. It also doesn't seem practical to
keep adding dependencies as needed to this image. This would cause image bloat
and I would have to rebuild the image any time I want to add
something. Instead I wanted a way to run this image as a conduit for my other
tools.

The solution I eventually reached was to simply **run** the isolated `openvpn`
container as normal, **then** run a command in the containers **network
namespace**. That way I get the network isolation I want, **with** the ability to
isolate the entire execution of a command behind a VPN.

To do this I ran the container with privileges to create a `tun` interface
like so:

```bash
podman run --rm --cap-add NET_ADMIN,NET_RAW --device /dev/net/tun \
       --name ${CONTAINER_NAME} \
       -v /tmp/ovpn/:/tmp/ovpn/ \
       -it -d ${NAME} \
       bash -c "
       openvpn \
       --config $FILE \
       --auth-nocache \
       --auth-retry nointeract \
       --dev $tun \
       --dev-type tun \
       --errors-to-stderr \
       --auth-user-pass <(echo -e '$USERNAME\n$PASSWORD')
       " 1>&2
```

Then I used `nsenter` to run a command in the context of the containers
network namespace:

```bash
...
PID=$(podman inspect ${CONTAINER_NAME} | jq -r '.[0] | .State.Pid')
nsenter -U -n -t $PID $@
```

This worked just as expected, and when the command finishes, the container can
be stopped and removed for seamless cleanup.

Hooray containers and namespaces! ðŸ“¦ðŸŽŠ

Wrapping this all together in a script `run_behind_vpn`, I can now run a
command masquerading as different IPs like so:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export USERNAME=$USERNAME
export PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
export US=$(find /tmp/ovpn/*us* -print -quit) # find a US ovpn file
export JAPAN=$(find /tmp/ovpn/*jp* -print -quit) # find a JP ovpn file
run_behind_vpn $US -- curl -s ipinfo.io | jq -r '.country'
run_behind_vpn $JAPAN -- curl -s ipinfo.io | jq -r '.country'
```

```text
US
JP
```

Now if I ever need to pretend that I'm running my computer from a different
country or need a new IP, I have a method to do so.
