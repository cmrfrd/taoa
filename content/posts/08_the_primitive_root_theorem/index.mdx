## What is the primitive root theorem

In this post I'm going to break down one of the most non intuitive, yet
foundational proofs in number/group theory.

The primitive root theorem theorem states that:

> If F is a finite field, then F - {O} is a cyclic group under multiplication.

Although this theorem can be written as a single statement, there is a lot of
complexity to unpack. The most obvious first step to understanding this
theorem is to break down the underlying terms. The operative words in this
statement that do most of the heavy lifting are "finite field" and "cyclic
group".


### Finite fields

A finite field is simply a mathematical set which contains finitely many
elements of whom we can perform basic math on (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division). This definition is a very abstract notion of
what a finite field is and for all intents and purposes we will only be
looking at the finite fields described by the integers modulo the primes.

  For clarity all finite fields are of size Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 28 2021, 08:57:49)

>>> for some prime
   and positive integer . For the
   case this must be true because if a finite field of size
   was factorable (a.k.a ), then
  there would exist two elements that multiply to the additive identity which
  contradicts the definition of a field.
