Thanks for coming to my site! If the box above shows 'running' then
congratulations! You are actively contributing hash power to the Monero proof of
work consensus algorithm!

If you have no idea what that means, then don't worry about it! Just know that
keeping this tab open supports me in writing more content online ðŸ’ž

For those of you that *do* know what this means, you are most likely thinking
"how is this even possible?" You people are my target audience for this post.

There are most likely a lot of questions you might be thinking so I'm going to
try and pre-emptively answer as many as I can.

## How did you make this?

Webassembly and a little crypto knowledge (I'll elaborate more farther down)

## But isn't this crypto-jacking?

Kinda not really. Crypto-jacking implies I'm trying to actively steal your CPU
power, instead I'm being upfront and enabling you to donate your CPU power as a
way to support an up in coming creator.

You also saw the title of this post and have read up until this point so you are
obviously at least a little curious about how this works.

## Is the $ this post has made live?

It is! Come back in a few days to see the current revenue of this post is!

## Aren't Monero wallets private? How are we seeing the wallet balance?

That's a great question! Every Monero wallet comes with two sets of keys, one
for spending and one for viewing. By publishing your wallet address and view
key, anyone can transparently see your balance which is great for an application
like this!
