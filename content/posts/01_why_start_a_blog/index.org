* Motivation

  There are many motivations for starting a blog. Mine are pretty simple. New
  and eccentric ideas are worth pursuing, and worth sharing!

  I've been reading and learning from tech blogs by people like [[https://jvns.ca][Julia Evans]],
  [[https://bost.ocks.org/mike/][Mike Bostock]], or [[https://koaning.io][Vincent Warmerdam]] for the past several years. They have
  consistently inspired and filled me with a new sense of awe for what it means
  to build and exhibit ideas. I felt it was time to start a blog of my own,
  about topics I care about, with a theme I find motivating, fun, and
  interesting.

  In this first post I want to set the stage for future posts by going over this
  blog's overarching theme, goals, and a little bit about the underlying tech.

* The Art of Abstraction

  /"First you learn the value of abstraction, then you learn the cost of
  abstraction, then you're ready to engineer."/ -- Kent Beck

  Abstractions are tools used to simplify complex ideas. They are a medium to
  ease our minds from tasks at hand so we don't need to fully digest the deeper
  underlying concepts, just the higher level idea. An example of this is how to
  drive a car. Understanding how the car regulates the optimal air to fuel ratio
  is not necessary to know how to drive. The driver just needs to understand how
  to turn the steering wheel and push on the gas pedal to go the direction they
  want.

  A steering wheel and a gas pedal is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are
  countless other abstractions that researchers and engineers spend their whole
  careers assembling and arguing over.

  Abstractions are thrown out, re-evaluated, superseded, then thrown out again,
  all as part of a process, not an end destination. At the end of the day,
  abstractions are speculative in their value and normally tend to scratch
  a specific itch.

  How people choose the right abstractions to represent the essence of some
  underlying process fascinates me. This led me to choose the name and
  overarching theme, *The Art of Abstraction*, for this blog. This message boiled
  down into a simple phrase serves as the best bedrock I can think of for how to
  link new and interesting topics under a single narrative.

* Drafting the right seed goals

  When starting any project, it's usually a good idea to establish a "North
  Star" so it's readily apparent when the project's direction is veering off and
  how to course correct.

  One effective "North Star" is a well designed set of goals. It's important to
  be aware however, that goals are no different from abstractions. Goals should
  be crafted with the expectation that they will one day be reshaped to fit the
  changing circumstances they occupy.

  Don't expect these goals to be the bedrock, but instead as the seed for future
  goals to grow from.

  1. *Cultivate a digital garden*

     The concept of a /"Digital Garden"/ has an [[https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history][interesting history]] and is a
     very unique idea (see [[https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/][this]] or [[https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden][this]] for more).

     /"The phrase 'digital garden' is a metaphor for thinking about writing and
     creating that focuses less on the resulting 'showpiece' and more on the
     process, care, and craft it takes to get there."/

     Using the abstraction of the /"garden"/ in this analogy to describe this
     blog is one I can respect and makes everything feel grounded. Phrases like
     "pulling weeds," "planting seeds," and "watering" have metaphorical
     connotations for growing a healthy blog as well as literal connotations for
     growing a beautiful garden.

     This concept empasizes the journey of the creation process and not any one
     destination.

  2. *Stock OVER flow*

     For a great overview of this idea, check out these two amazing blogs ([[https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/][tomcritchlow]] and ) [[]wo]] amazing [[http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890]logs]] from
     which this goal has been appropriated.

     /"Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily
     and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist./

     /Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as
     interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people
     discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans
     over time."/

     /Stock over flow/ imposes the opinion that the content creation process
     should prioritize the verbose and long lasting, over the immediate and
     short form /"status updates."/ I believe /"stock"/ content sticks in
     people's minds longer and provides repeated value. If you put the work into
     a post that improves the life of others, people will recognize it and share
     it, reciprocating the value back to you.

     This goal is not meant to disregard /"flow"/ and maybe in the future *The
     Art of Abstraction* will produce /"flow"/ content. But in these early days
     it's time to establish a solid base and build /"stock."/

  3. *Show AND tell*

     Most stories presented in a blog lend themselves to text and images, but there
     are series of amazing untold stories that would have an elevated and profound
     impact if told interactively.

     Blog posts from places like [[https://distill.pub/][distill.pub]], [[https://blog.tensorflow.org/][TensorFlow blog]], or
     [[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-tuesday/][fivethirtyeight]] include interactive portions where users can literally
     click and play with a post and watch how information changes. Experiences
     like these bring out the kid in me who goofed off playing Flash games to
     pass the time in school. Interactivity can create a fun experience and
     leave people just a tiny bit happier than they were before. I want this for
     all blog readers.

     To clarify, not every post should or can be expressed with interactivity.
     But future content deserves to have the option. Sometimes just a simple
     button that does something fun will hopefully bring a smile to a reader's
     face.

* The tech 🖥

  If you want to build any technology-based product, you need to choose the
  right giants to stand on, and the right [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack][stack]] for you.

  After researching how sites were built in the past, then watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWTMEDEPw8c][lecture]]
  after [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCATu2WkOq8][lecture]] after [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZLS4cq7fRY][lecture]] about how they are being built now, I have
  officially drunk the Kool-Aid and am now a proponent of subjectively "modern"
  web development. Reading the philosophy of the [[https://jamstack.wtf/][JAM stack]], the [[https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl/][PRPL]] pattern,
  and learning about the utility of [[https://www.staticgen.com/][static site generators]] (SSGs) has really
  opened my eyes to a new set of tools for building amazing experiences
  online. The development principles from other proponents of these ideas
  consistently line up with my own and make me feel that I'm moving in the right
  direction.

  There are [[https://github.com/topics/blog-engine][hundreds]] of blogging engines and SSGs to choose from. Each has its
  own unique utility or caters to a specific developer community. When
  finding the right SSG for this site I didn't do any particular pro/con
  analysis. Instead I simply explored what tools were out there, took them out
  for a test run, then determined what would be the best "/fit/" for my
  particular workflow. After playing with 10 or so SSGs I came to a few
  conclusions that helped me narrow down the selection.

  - *Markup converters are your friends* :clipboard:

    Every developer has their favorite markup language, whether that be
    Markdown, LaTeX, or straight HTML. What's better than a really cool markup
    language? Really cool markup converters! Tools like [[https://pandoc.org/index.html][pandoc]] that convert your
    favorite markup language to the format you need are awesome and should be
    used more! The right converter is a must if want to stick with your favorite
    markup language.

  - *It's the quality that counts* :rainbow:

    Quality of software, like age or number of GitHub stars, is a controversial
    topic. Some people use older software because it may be stable and
    well-known. The other side opts to use newer software because it may use
    best practices, is actively maintained, or all the cool kids are using it.

    There are a myriad of other reasons to choose your tools. I believe
    it's important to constantly re-evaluate and check your own reasoning and
    not to be swayed by shiny toys. Don't choose software just because everyone
    else is using it. Don't be a lemming.

** The tools for the job

  #+CAPTION: The Art of Abstraction's picture stack
  [[./images/stack.png]]

  Here is a synopsis of the core dependencies for *The Art of Abstraction*

  1. [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/][*Gatsby*]]

     /"Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
     developers build blazing fast websites and apps"/ -- gatsbyjs.org

     Modern front-end development is *overwhelming* and *hard*. In order to have
     a website /feel/ and /behave/ like a modern web app, there are so many
     boxes that need to be checked. Gatsby easily checks many of those boxes and
     is the best shortcut I've found for doing /modern/ web development in an
     approachable way.

     Some amazing features that attracted me to Gatsby are

     - /Configuration and setup is straightforward/

     - /Integrates with the whole React ecosystem/

     - /Great catalog of OSS plugins/

     As somone who isn't a front-end developer who is faced with the difficulty
     of front-end development, Gatsby feels like a breath of fresh air.

  2. [[https://mdxjs.com/][*MDX*]]

     /"MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your
     Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts
     or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form
     content with components a blast."/ -- mdxjs.com

     Markdown is an extremely effective document writing format. The syntax is
     pretty painless, it's easy to write, easy to read, and integrates well with
     a plethora of other tools. While searching for blogging tools I came across
     MDX and it was instant chemistry 💛🖤. After writing and feeling the
     experience of Markdown+JSX, I knew it was the right choice for writing
     interactive content in a familiar format.

     As an added bonus, MDX is a [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/][plugin in Gatsby]].

  3. [[https://orgmode.org/][*Emacs org-mode*]]

     /"Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects,
     and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system."/ --
     orgmode.org

     I've used Emacs and Org for the past few years for professional and
     personal work, I'm full steam ahead on Emacs and don't have any signs of
     switching to another editor any time soon. It works extremely well for my
     workflow and it's the best highly integrated mess I've ever used.

     Additionally, from a portability standpoint, Org can also export to
     a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][bunch]] number of formats, including markdown.

     ~The dev flow:~

     ~Org -> MDX -> Gatsby~

* In search of awe

  Humans love to tell stories, and if you believe in [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Littlewood%27s_law][Littlewood's Law]], there are
  rare experiences worth talking about. I believe there are amazing untold
  stories about topics in engineering and math that are worth talking about to
  the world at large. In future posts I hope to fill readers with a sense of awe
  for our crazy technical and largely invisible world.

  Thanks for reading!
