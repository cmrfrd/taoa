## Motivation

There are many motivations for starting a blog. Mine are pretty simple. New
and eccentric ideas are worth pursuing, and worth sharing!

I've been reading and learning from tech blogs by people like [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca),
[Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/), or [Vincent Warmerdam](https://koaning.io) for the past several years. They have
consistently inspired and filled me with a new sense of awe for what it means
to build and exhibit ideas. I felt it was time to start a blog of my own,
about topics I care about, with a theme I find motivating, fun, and
interesting.

In this first post I want to set the stage for future posts by going over this
blog's overarching theme, goals, and a little bit about the underlying tech.


## The Art of Abstraction

_"First you learn the value of abstraction, then you learn the cost of
abstraction, then you're ready to engineer."_ -- Kent Beck

Abstractions are tools used to simplify complex ideas. They are a medium to
ease our minds from tasks at hand so we don't need to fully digest the deeper
underlying concepts, just the higher level idea. An example of this is how to
drive a car. Understanding how the car regulates the optimal air to fuel ratio
is not necessary to know how to drive. The driver just needs to understand how
to turn the steering wheel and push on the gas pedal to go the direction they
want.

A steering wheel and a gas pedal is just the tip of the iceberg, as there are
countless other abstractions that researchers and engineers spend their whole
careers assembling and arguing over.

Abstractions are thrown out, re-evaluated, superseded, then thrown out again,
all as part of a process, not an end destination. At the end of the day,
abstractions are speculative in their value and normally tend to scratch
a specific itch.

How people choose the right abstractions to represent the essence of some
underlying process fascinates me. This led me to choose the name and
overarching theme, **The Art of Abstraction**, for this blog. This message boiled
down into a simple phrase serves as the best bedrock I can think of for how to
link new and interesting topics under a single narrative.


## Drafting the right seed goals

When starting any project, it's usually a good idea to establish a "North
Star" so it's readily apparent when the project's direction is veering off and
how to course correct.

One effective "North Star" is a well designed set of goals. It's important to
be aware however, that goals are no different from abstractions. Goals should
be crafted with the expectation that they will one day be reshaped to fit the
changing circumstances they occupy.

Don't expect these goals to be the bedrock, but instead as the seed for future
goals to grow from.

1.  **Cultivate a digital garden**

    The concept of a _"Digital Garden"_ has an [interesting history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and is a
    very unique idea (see [this](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) or [this](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) for more).

    _"The phrase 'digital garden' is a metaphor for thinking about writing and
    creating that focuses less on the resulting 'showpiece' and more on the
    process, care, and craft it takes to get there."_

    Using the abstraction of the _"garden"_ in this analogy to describe this
    blog is one I can respect and makes everything feel grounded. Phrases like
    "pulling weeds," "planting seeds," and "watering" have metaphorical
    connotations for growing a healthy blog as well as literal connotations for
    growing a beautiful garden.

    This concept emphasizes the journey of the creation process and not any one
    destination.

2.  **Stock OVER flow**

    For a great overview of this idea, check out these two amazing blogs
    ([tomcritchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) and [Robin Sloan](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890)) from which this goal has been appropriated.

    _"Flow is the feed. Itâ€™s the posts and the tweets. Itâ€™s the stream of daily
    and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist._

    _Stock is the durable stuff. Itâ€™s the content you produce thatâ€™s as
    interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. Itâ€™s what people
    discover via search. Itâ€™s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans
    over time."_

    _Stock over flow_ imposes the opinion that the content creation process
    should prioritize the verbose and long lasting, over the immediate and
    short form _"status updates."_ I believe _"stock"_ content sticks in
    people's minds longer and provides repeated value. If you put the work into
    a post that improves the life of others, people will recognize it and share
    it, reciprocating the value back to you.

    This goal is not meant to disregard _"flow"_ and maybe in the future **The
    Art of Abstraction** will produce _"flow"_ content. But in these early days
    it's time to establish a solid base and build _"stock."_

3.  **Show AND tell**

    Most stories presented in a blog lend themselves to text and images, but there
    are series of amazing untold stories that would have an elevated and profound
    impact if told interactively.

    Blog posts from places like [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/), [TensorFlow blog](https://blog.tensorflow.org/), or
    [fivethirtyeight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-tuesday/) include interactive portions where users can literally
    click and play with a post and watch how information changes. Experiences
    like these bring out the kid in me who goofed off playing Flash games to
    pass the time in school. Interactivity can create a fun experience and
    leave people just a tiny bit happier than they were before. I want this for
    all blog readers.

    To clarify, not every post should or can be expressed with interactivity.
    But future content deserves to have the option. Sometimes just a simple
    button that does something fun will hopefully bring a smile to a reader's
    face.

<div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center'
}}>
   <ConfettiButton
    settings={{
      type: 'confetti',
      fakingRequest: false,
      angle: 90,
      decay: 0.91,
      spread: 100,
      startVelocity: 30,
      elementCount: 50,
      elementSize: 10,
      lifetime: 100,
      zIndex: 10,
      springAnimation: false
    }}
    text="Click Me!  ðŸŽŠ"
   />
</div>


## The tech ðŸ’»

If you want to build any technology-based product, you need to choose the
right giants to stand on, and the right [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) for you.

After researching how sites were built in the past, then watching [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWTMEDEPw8c)
after [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCATu2WkOq8) after [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZLS4cq7fRY) about how they are being built now, I'm
sufficently convinced of these new practices and am now a proponent of
subjectively "modern" web development. Reading the philosophy of the [JAM
stack](https://jamstack.wtf/), the [PRPL](https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl/) pattern, and learning about the utility of [static site
generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) (SSGs) has really opened my eyes to a new set of tools for building
amazing experiences online. The development principles from other proponents
of these ideas consistently line up with my own and make me feel that I'm
moving in the right direction.

There are [hundreds](https://github.com/topics/blog-engine) of blogging engines and SSGs to choose from. Each has its
own unique utility or caters to a specific developer community. When
finding the right SSG for this site I didn't do any particular pro/con
analysis. Instead I simply explored what tools were out there, took them out
for a test run, then determined what would be the best "_fit_" for my
particular workflow. After playing with 10 or so SSGs I came to a few
conclusions that helped me narrow down the selection.

-   **Markup converters are your friends** :clipboard:

    Every developer has their favorite markup language, whether that be
    Markdown, LaTeX, or straight HTML. What's better than a really cool markup
    language? Really cool markup converters! Tools like [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) that convert your
    favorite markup language to the format you need are awesome and should be
    used more! The right converter is a must if want to stick with your favorite
    markup language.

-   **It's the quality that counts** :rainbow:

    Quality of software, like age or number of GitHub stars, is a controversial
    topic. Some people use older software because it may be stable and
    well-known. The other side opts to use newer software because it may use
    best practices, is actively maintained, or all the cool kids are using it.

    There are a myriad of other reasons to choose your tools. I believe
    it's important to constantly re-evaluate and check your own reasoning and
    not to be swayed by shiny toys. Don't choose software just because everyone
    else is using it. Don't be a lemming.


### The tools for the job

![img](./images/stack.png "The Art of Abstraction's picture stack")

Here is a synopsis of the core dependencies for **The Art of Abstraction**

1.  [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

    _"Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
    developers build blazing fast websites and apps"_ -- gatsbyjs.org

    Modern front-end development is **overwhelming** and **hard**. In order to have
    a website _feel_ and _behave_ like a modern web app, there are so many
    boxes that need to be checked. Gatsby easily checks many of those boxes and
    is the best shortcut I've found for doing _modern_ web development in an
    approachable way.

    Some amazing features that attracted me to Gatsby are

    -   _Configuration and setup is straightforward_
    -   _Integrates with the whole React ecosystem_
    -   _Great catalog of OSS plugins_

    As somone who isn't a front-end developer who is faced with the difficulty
    of front-end development, Gatsby feels like a breath of fresh air.

2.  [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/)

    _"MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your
    Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts
    or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form
    content with components a blast."_ -- mdxjs.com

    Markdown is an extremely effective document writing format. The syntax is
    pretty painless, it's easy to write, easy to read, and is a target format
    for a plethora of other tools. While searching for blogging tools I came
    across MDX and it was instant chemistry ðŸ’›ðŸ–¤. After writing and feeling the
    experience of Markdown+JSX, I knew it was the right choice for writing
    interactive content in a familiar format.

    As an added bonus, MDX is a [plugin in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/).

3.  [**Emacs org-mode**](https://orgmode.org/)

    _"Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects,
    and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system."_ --
    orgmode.org

    I've used Emacs and Org for the past few years for professional and
    personal work, I'm full steam ahead on Emacs and don't have any signs of
    switching to another editor any time soon. It works extremely well for my
    workflow and it's the best highly integrated mess I've ever used.

    Additionally, from a portability standpoint, Org can also export to
    a [bunch](https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html) number of formats, including markdown.

    `The dev flow:`

    `Org -> MDX -> Gatsby`


## In search of awe

Humans love to tell stories, and if you believe in [Littlewood's Law](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Littlewood%27s_law), there are
rare experiences worth talking about. I believe there are amazing untold
stories about topics in engineering and math that are worth talking about to
the world at large. In future posts I hope to fill readers with a sense of awe
for our crazy technical and largely invisible world.

Thanks for reading!
