* “The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed.”
	― William Gibson

* Goal of this presentation

  To share one potential future of AI agent payments

* Outline

  1. LLMs and the "Outside World" (APIs)
  2. How we pay for APIs today
  3. Using cryptocurrency for API payments
     - Payment Channels
  4. Research prototype (pay-per-prompt)

* The rocks can +type+ use the internet!

	- LLM structured output has made it possible for LLMs to use "anything"
  - This is the future of AI agent systems
	- Examples:
		- OpenAI operator mode or Claude computer use
		- MCP Servers

* How we pay for APIs today

	1. Make an account
	2. Enter credit card details
	3. Copy paste an API key
	4. Use the API + API key
	5. Pay at the end of the month

* How do we make API payments as easy as possible for AI agents?

* So what if?

	1. +Make an account+
	2. +Enter credit card details+
	3. +Copy paste an API key+
	4. Use the API (and pay as we go)
	5. +Pay at the end of the month+

* How?

	With cryptocurrency payment channels

* Merits and demerits of cryptocurrency payments

	- Merits:
		- Lower fees than traditional payment platforms
		- High programmability
		- Gas costs are relatively cheap

	- Demerits:
		- Transactions are irreversible / no buyer protection
		- Difficult user on-boarding
		- Uncertain regulatory outcome and tax implications

* What are payment channels? (1/4)

	A payment channel is a peer-to-peer network that enables participants to
	perform numerous transactions among themselves and only submit the final
	results of the processing and computation to the main blockchain.

  Payment channels are commonly called a "layer two" scaling solution for
  blockchains.

* What are payment channels? (3/4)

* Payment channels abstracted

  [[file:./assets/State_Channels_Hierarchy.png]]

* Why Payment Channels?

  - *Cheap*: We only pay blockchain fees on opening and closing a channel.
  - *Speed:* Near-instant “off-chain” transactions, enabling real-time payments.
  - *Scalability:* Do many transactions now, settle on the blockchain later.
  - *Longevity*: Do many transactions over a long period of time.

* The prototype: Pay-Per-Prompt

  Build a proof of concept where we can pay for LLM inference on a
  "prompt-by-prompt" basis with cryptocurrency.
