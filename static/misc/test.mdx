I am currently learning abstract algebra through a tutor after realizing how in
over my head I was learning elliptic curve pairings. On an abstract level I
understand billinear maps (which are the desired result produced by elliptic
curve pairings), but wawaweewa the underlying mechanisms are
NOT SIMPLE.

I thought I understood a lot of the fundamentals of elliptic curves, but in
order to understand "pairings" you need almost an order of magnitude more
knowledge of elliptic curves to do so.

In order to grow my mathematical foundation I'm leveraging the help of a tutor
to help me smooth over the gaps of my knowledge.

I am starting with undergrad content in abstract algebra here:

<https://www.math.miami.edu/~armstrong/562sp22/562sp22notes.pdf>

My primary goal is to be able to retain and use this knowledge as a stepping
stone for further complicated topics. To achieve this I'll be taking digestible
pieces from the source material and produce a few blog post (maybe about the
proofs).


## Homework #1


### Setup

```emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-python-command (format "%s/sage" (getenv "SCRIPTS")))
(setq py-default-interpreter (format "%s/sage" (getenv "SCRIPTS")))
```

```python
import multiprocessing.pool
import functools

def timeout(max_timeout):
    """Timeout decorator, parameter in seconds."""
    def timeout_decorator(item):
        """Wrap the original function."""
        @functools.wraps(item)
        def func_wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            """Closure for function."""
            pool = multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool(processes=1)
            async_result = pool.apply_async(item, args, kwargs)
            # raises a TimeoutError if execution exceeds max_timeout
            return async_result.get(max_timeout)
        return func_wrapper
    return timeout_decorator
```


### Question 1

Write a computer program to compute the order of a mod n, i.e., the smallest
r>=1 such that a^r = 1 mod n.

```python
@timeout(3.0)
def find_order_naive(a, n):
    '''
    solves for r:
    a^r = 1 mod n
    '''
    r = 1
    while pow(a, r, n) != 1:
        r += 1
    return r

print(find_order_naive(10, 17))
```

```text
16
```


### Question 2

Use your program to find the order of every element of (Z/13Z)^X. Since
phi(13)=12 we know from Euler's totient theorem that the order of every
element of (Z/13)^X has order that divides 12.

```python
ring_size = 13
results = [["Element", "Order", f"Div{ring_size-1}"]]
for elem in range(2, ring_size):
    order = find_order_naive(elem, ring_size)
    results.append(
        [
         elem,
         order,
         (ring_size-1) % order == 0
         ]
  )
results
```

| Element | Order | Div12 |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 2       | 12    | True  |
| 3       | 3     | True  |
| 4       | 6     | True  |
| 5       | 4     | True  |
| 6       | 12    | True  |
| 7       | 12    | True  |
| 8       | 4     | True  |
| 9       | 3     | True  |
| 10      | 6     | True  |
| 11      | 12    | True  |
| 12      | 2     | True  |

Compute phi(d) for every divisor of 12, i.e., for d=1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

```python
from sympy import divisors
from sympy.ntheory import factorint, divisors

def totient(n):
    prime_factors = factorint(n, limit=10000)
    ans = n
    for p in prime_factors.keys():
        ans *= 1 - (1/p)
    return ans

for d in divisors(12):
    print(totient(d))

```

```text
1
1.0
2.0
2.0
2.0
4.0
```

Observe that the number of elements of (Z/13Z)^X of order d equals phi(d). In
particular, observe that there are phi(12) elements of order 12. These are the
"generators" of (Z/13)^X.

We will prove later that the same ideas hold for (Z/pZ)^X whenever p is prime.


## Homework #2


### Primitive root theorem

For any finite field F the group of units (F\*,\*,1) is cyclic. (Write F\* for
the nonzero elements of F.) That is, there exists a nonzero element a in F
such that every nonzero element has the form a^k for some integer k.

The proof has three major steps:

1.  Any polynomial of degree n over F has at most n roots in F.

    If we assume know that polynomials and their degrees have the following
    properties:

    \begin{align} p\left(x\right) = {\prod_{i=1}^{m} -c_{i} + x} \\ {\rm deg}\left(p_{1}\left(x\right)\right) + {\rm deg}\left(p_{2}\left(x\right)\right) = {\rm deg}\left(p_{1}\left(x\right) p_{2}\left(x\right)\right) \end{align}

    where every c<sub>i</sub> is a "zero" of the
    polynomial. Say we have two non zero polynomials p and g with p having
    degree n:

    \begin{align} p\left(x\right) = g\left(x\right) {\prod_{i=1}^{m} -c_{i} + x} \\ n = {\rm deg}\left(p\left(x\right)\right) \\ n = m + {\rm deg}\left(g\left(x\right)\right) \\ -m + n = {\rm deg}\left(g\left(x\right)\right) \end{align}

    Line 6 must be true because the degree of a polynomial cannot be
    negative. This inequality also holds if f is of order 0 or 1.

    This means that by line 2,
    $ p\left(x\right) $ must have atleast  roots.

2.  If F\* contains an element of order d, then it contains exactly phi(d)
    elements of order d.

    Starting here:

    \begin{align} {\rm Ord}\left(a^{k}\right) = {\rm Ord}\left(a^{{\rm gcd}\left(k, n\right)}\right) \\ {\rm Ord}\left(a^{k}\right) = \frac{n}{{\rm gcd}\left(k, n\right)} \end{align}

    we know line 7 is true due to Bezoutâ€™s Identity. We also know that any
    divisor of $ n $ will have
    an order $ {\rm Ord}\left(a^{k}\right) = \frac{n}{k} $. Lastly since
    $ {\rm gcd}\left(k, d\right) $ is a divisor of
    $ d $ (by definition) we can combine these two to form
    line 8.

1.  The sum of phi(d) over the divisors of n equals n. Example:
    phi(1)+phi(2)+phi(3)+phi(6)=1+1+2+2=6.


### Satisfying the primitive root theorem

On page 197 of the algebra notes there is the multiplication table of a field
of size eight. It has elements {0, 1, alpha, alpha^2, 1+alpha, 1+alpha^2,
alpha+alpha^2, 1+alpha+alpha^2}. The coefficients are integers mod 2 (so
+1=-1) and alpha is an "imaginary number" satisfying alpha^3+alpha^2+1=0.

Problem: Verify explicitly that this field satisfies the Primitive Root
Theorem. That is, find a nonzero element whose powers give all seven nonzero
elements. More generally, find the order of every nonzero element.
